        <h1>DEATH NOTE</h1>

        <div class="contant">
            <p>Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by
                Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death
                Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone
                whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death
                Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free
                society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite
                Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran in Shueisha's
                manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12
                tankōbon volumes.</p>
