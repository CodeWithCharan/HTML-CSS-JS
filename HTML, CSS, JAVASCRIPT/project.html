    <div class="content"> Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the
        story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage,
        the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts â€“ the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the
        second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned
        Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).<p> </p>
